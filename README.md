👋🏼 Hi, I’m @kelsIam!

💻 I’m a software engineer with experience contributing to open-source tools, and developing full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript applications using modularized React, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. 

📚 My passion for lifelong learning has defined my journey in the industry. 

When I’m away from my desk, you can find me walking about with a camera 📸 in hand, 🐈‍⬛ cats in tow 🐈, and a tote bag filled with books, blue headphones 🎧, and a journal 📓.
